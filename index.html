The goal is to highlight terms/acronyms that our users may be unfamiliar with. The glossary terms are automatically highlighted on each page. Clicking on a term will toggle the glossary from off-screen and automatically enter the term you clicked into the search box. The terms list will then filter to reveal terms that match your search (the word that you clicked on as well as any related terms). This sentance has the word Threatened Species in it.</p><p>Adaptation.</p><button class=glossary-toggle>Toggle Glossary</button></div><script src=./js/bundle.js></script>
