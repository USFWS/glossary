## Off-Canvas Glossary

This glossary supplements the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Southeast Regional website](http://fws.gov/southeast).  The goal of this glossary is to provide definitions to terms that may be unclear to our users. We are focused on writing content in plain language, but terms associated with Rules and Regulations may be foreign to our users.  This glossary automatically searches the current page for glossary terms, highlights them, and makes them clickable.  Clicking a term will summon the glossary from off-screen.  When you're done reading the definition you can return to your place on the page.

### Development

To ease development we use npm scripts to compile JS with browserify/watchify, compile sass to css, optimize images, etc:

First, install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

To kick off the development server and all pre-requisite tasks:

`npm start`

To build a production ready version of the app use:

`npm run build`

To publish a production ready demo to GitHub Pages:

`npm run publish:demo`

To visualize packages contributing to bundle file size:

`npm run inspect:bundle`
