    "description": "To “adapt” means to change with changes in the environment. <br><br>In the context of wildlife and habitat conservation, adaptation techniques are scientifically sound methods used to deal with the effects of climate change. For example, parts of Alligator National Wildlife Refuge are being flooded due to the world’s rising sea levels. When a road or path that was once on the beach becomes swallowed by the sea, we must adapt and build a new road in a new location rather than attempting to repair the old road that will now be lost to the ocean.<br><br><a href='http://www.fws.gov/home/climatechange/adaptation.html'>Learn more about climate change adaptation</a>",
